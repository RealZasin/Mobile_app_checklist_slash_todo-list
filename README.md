# Mobile_app_checklist_slash_todo-list
A scrimba project where we create a mobile app where we can add things to remember, or things do to. 
It will take value from a input field and add them to a list that we can use through our day. 
It will laso use a server from google called firebase to store the data and when the task is done, we can click the task and it will be removed.
